Travel Planner Web Application
I have developed a user-friendly Travel Planner web application that helps users plan trips efficiently by selecting destinations, dates, activities, and budgets. The platform offers dynamic itinerary creation, interactive maps, and personalized suggestions to enhance travel experiences. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it ensures smooth performance and an engaging interface.
